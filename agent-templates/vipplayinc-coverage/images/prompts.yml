        RULES FOR OPINION/PREDICTION IMAGES ON TV:

        MAIN OBJECTIVE:
        - Engagement: Create questions that encourage participation, debate, and expression of the fan's OPINION or EXPECTATION about the game.
        - Context: Use information from the Reference Document (`doc_context`) as BACKGROUND to make the question relevant and informed, but the final answer is the public's OPINION.

        IMAGE STRUCTURE:
        - Question: Short, direct, and formulated to ask for an opinion, prediction, or evaluation (Ex: "Who do you think...?", "What is the biggest challenge...?", "What to expect from...?", "How do you rate...?", "Could it be that...?").
        - Options: 2 to 4 SHORT answer options representing different viewpoints, feelings, or plausible predictions.
        - Variation: Avoid repeating the same type of question or answer structure in sequence.
