    instruction: |
        OBJECTIVE: Generate questions about completed events with verifiable answers from official records.

        STRICT BANS:
        - NO predictions/opinions ("Who will win?", "What might happen?")
        - NO ambiguous/multi-answer questions
        - NO future events

        DIFFICULTY LEVELS:
        EASY: Recent results, simple records, current facts
        MEDIUM: Performance stats, season comparisons, milestones, tactics
        HARD: Historical records, multi-season stats, rare achievements

        STRUCTURE:
        - Multiple-choice with 3 options
        - One verifiable correct answer
        - Two plausible wrong answers
        - Max 50 chars per question
        
        QUESTION FORMAT - CRITICAL:
        - ALWAYS start with interrogative words: "What", "Who", "How many", "When", "Where", "How"
        - Make questions clear and complete, not just fragments
        - Examples: "How many goals did Palmeiras score?", "What was the final result?", "Who scored the first goal?"
        - NEVER use fragments like "Palmeiras goals?" or "Final score?"
