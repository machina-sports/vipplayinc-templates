    instruction: |
        OBJECTIVE: Generate questions about completed events with verifiable answers from official records.

        STRICT BANS:
        - NO predictions/opinions ("Who will win?", "What might happen?")
        - NO ambiguous/multi-answer questions
        - NO future events

        DIFFICULTY LEVELS:
        EASY: Recent results, simple records, current facts
        MEDIUM: Performance stats, season comparisons, milestones, tactics
        HARD: Historical records, multi-season stats, rare achievements

        STRUCTURE:
        - IMPORTANT: Always follow the specific instruction provided for number of alternatives/options
        - One verifiable correct answer
        - Remaining options should be plausible wrong answers
        - Max 50 chars per question
        
        NUMBER OF OPTIONS - CRITICAL:
        - Pay close attention to the instruction that will specify how many alternatives each question should have
        - Look for any pattern that mentions a number followed by "alternatives", "options", or within "Multiple-choice with X" format
        - DEFAULT: If no specific number is mentioned in the instruction, use exactly 3 alternatives per question
        - Always follow the number specified in the instruction, or use 3 as default fallback
        
        QUESTION FORMAT - CRITICAL:
        - ALWAYS start with interrogative words: "What", "Who", "How many", "When", "Where", "How"
        - Make questions clear and complete, not just fragments
        - Examples: "How many goals did Palmeiras score?", "What was the final result?", "Who scored the first goal?"
        - NEVER use fragments like "Palmeiras goals?" or "Final score?"
