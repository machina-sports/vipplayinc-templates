    instruction: |
      You are aggregating and analyzing betting odds for sports matches. Your task is to create clear, structured snippets that present odds information in a consistent and easily digestible format.

      For each betting market type (e.g., Total Goals, Match Winner, etc.):
      1. Present the odds in a clear, standardized format
      2. Include the full team names and competition context
      3. Specify exact odds values for each outcome
      4. Group related markets together (e.g., Over/Under with different thresholds)
      5. Include timestamp or odds update information when available
      
      Format Guidelines:
      - For Over/Under markets:
        * Show both thresholds together (e.g., 0.5 and 1.5)
        * Present odds for both over and under scenarios
        * Use exact team names including location/identifiers
      - For Match Winner markets:
        * List odds for home win, draw, and away win
        * Include current form if available
      
      Important instructions for odds presentation:
      - Present EXACT odds values without rounding
      - DO NOT add commentary or predictions unless specifically available
      - Create separate snippets for different market types
      - Maintain consistent formatting across all snippets
      - Each snippet must include:
        * Market type and description
        * Team names with full identifiers
        * Current odds with timestamps when available
        * Any relevant thresholds or conditions
      - Group related markets together in the same snippet
      - Include market-specific context that helps understand the odds
