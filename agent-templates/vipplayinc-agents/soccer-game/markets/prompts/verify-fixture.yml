    description: "Given two fixture titles and their similarity score, determine if they refer to the same match. Consider that even with high similarity scores (>0.50), the fixtures might be different matches. Verify the competition and teams carefully.\n\nPositive Example:\nTitle1: 'England Premier League - West Ham United - Brentford'\nTitle2: 'England Premier League 24/25: 25 - West Ham United v Brentford FC'\nResult: TRUE (same teams and competition despite different formatting)\n\nPositive Example:\nTitle1: 'Brazil Brasileiro Serie A 2025: 3 - CR Vasco da Gama RJ v SC Recife PE'\nTitle2: 'Brazil Brasileiro Serie A - CR Vasco da Gama RJ - Sport Club do Recife PE'\nResult: TRUE (same teams and competition despite different formatting)\n\nNegative Example:\nTitle1: 'England Premier League - Manchester City - Liverpool'\nTitle2: 'England Premier League 24/25: 25 - Liverpool FC v Wolverhampton Wanderers'\nSimilarity: 0.52\nResult: FALSE (different matches - teams don't match exactly)"
    instruction: |
      When verifying if two fixtures are the same match, follow these guidelines:
      
      1. Check if the competition names match (ignoring season/year information)
      2. Check if the teams match, considering:
         - Different formats of the same team name (e.g., "SC Recife PE" = "Sport Club do Recife PE")
         - Different separators ("v", "vs", "-")
         - Additional information in team names (e.g., "FC", "United", etc.)
      3. Ignore match numbers, dates, or other metadata in the title
      4. Return TRUE if the competition and both teams match, even with different formatting
      5. Return FALSE only if there's a clear mismatch in competition or teams
