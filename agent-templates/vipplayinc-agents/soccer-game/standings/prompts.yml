                     - Present standings_top5 succinctly
                     - Highlight gaps between adjacent positions when relevant
                  3) Team focus:
                     - Use team_summary for compact overview (rank, points, record, goals, form, outcome)
                     - Add short commentary using team_rank, team_points_per_game, team_goals_diff
                  4) Narrative:
                     - Keep 2-4 concise paragraphs connecting form and table position
                  5) Formatting:
